Description	
The project aims to mitigate Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects in Ranchi by utilizing Google Earth Engine (GEE) to map climate parameters and identify areas with high solar exposure, such as rooftops, for urban greening efforts like rooftop gardens. Key elements of the project include: 1. UHI Analysis and Data Collection: Using GEE, the project will track essential climate parameters such as temperature, precipitation, and solar exposure. Landsat satellite imagery will be collected, and preprocessing techniques like cloud masking and radiometric calibration will ensure accurate extraction of Land Surface Temperature (LST). The Simplified Urban-Extent (SUE) algorithm will analyze temperature variations between urban and rural areas, allowing for fine-resolution, street-level UHI analysis. 2. Rooftop Agriculture for UHI Mitigation: Rooftop digitization will be conducted using Google Earth Pro, prioritizing rooftops with optimal sun exposure for urban agriculture, such as rooftop gardens and green spaces. Urban agriculture will not only mitigate UHI by cooling the environment but also address food security in Ranchi. Ground verification via mobile technology will ensure that selected rooftops are feasible for farming, considering factors such as size, structure, and access to water. 3. Real-Time Website for UHI Monitoring: A MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) will be used to develop a full-stack, interactive website that provides real-time UHI data and displays high-resolution climate maps at the street level. The website will integrate OpenStreetMap (OSM) for street-level mapping and Google Earth Engine datasets for geospatial analysis. Public access to climate data will allow residents, planners, and policymakers to view UHI hotspots and explore urban agriculture opportunities. 4. Additional UHI Mitigation Strategies: The project will incorporate the use of alternative heat-reducing materials, promoting construction practices such as double-wall constructions and green facades to reduce heat retention. Efforts to limit pollution from industries and minimize air conditioner usage will further contribute to reducing UHI effects. 5. Global Relevance and Application: This UHI mitigation approach draws inspiration from similar successful projects in other regions, such as the Netherlands' Urban Heat Mapping demonstration and UHI websites developed in the US and UK. The project aims to bring similar innovation to Ranchi, Jharkhand. By fostering green urban development, it promotes a circular economy approach, emphasizing the recycling of resources like rainwater and compost from rooftop farms. This comprehensive approach combines technology and community engagement to create a cooler, more livable urban environment while addressing climate change and ensuring that Ranchi becomes more environmentally sustainable and resilient.
Abstract/Summary	
Abstract: Urban Heat Island (UHI) Mitigation through Rooftop Urban Agriculture in Ranchi, Jharkhand Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a phenomenon where urban areas experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural regions, primarily due to the replacement of natural land cover with urban infrastructure such as buildings, roads, and pavements. This temperature disparity is more pronounced at night, especially during low wind conditions, and has numerous adverse effects, including increased energy consumption, elevated pollution levels, and heightened health risks. Given these impacts, UHI mitigation is crucial in addressing both local and global climate challenges. In Ranchi, Jharkhand, UHI effects are becoming more apparent as urbanization intensifies. This project proposes a multi-faceted approach to UHI mitigation by prioritizing urban rooftops for agricultural purposes. This concept integrates the environmental benefits of urban farming with technological innovations to create an efficient, scalable solution for both UHI reduction and food security enhancement. This project aims to: 1. Utilize Urban Rooftops for Agriculture: By identifying and prioritizing rooftops suitable for urban agriculture, the project can reduce the heat-absorbing surfaces in Ranchi while addressing food insecurity. Urban farming can lower rooftop temperatures, contribute to cooling the local environment, and promote sustainable food production. 2. Develop an Interactive Website for UHI Monitoring:The project will incorporate real-time or near-real-time data on UHI effects, using Open Street Map (OSM) data and Google Earth Engine (GEE) to provide street-level analysis of heat island intensities. The platform will offer climate information for specific areas of Ranchi, facilitating public access to environmental data. 3. Leverage Satellite Data and Geospatial Tools for UHI Analysis: Using Landsat satellite imagery collected and preprocessed through Google Earth Engine (GEE), the project will calculate Land Surface Temperature (LST) and UHI intensity using the Simplified Urban-Extent (SUE) algorithm. This will enable a comprehensive analysis of temperature differences between urban and rural areas, allowing for detailed mapping of UHI effects. 4. Digitize Rooftops and Ground-Truth Validation:High-resolution satellite data and tools like Google Earth Pro will be used to manually digitize and analyze rooftops in Ranchi, identifying those most suitable for urban agriculture based on factors such as surface area, sun exposure, and proximity to water sources. These digitized points will then be verified on the ground using mobile devices to assess feasibility for farming and agriculture. 5. Implement a Full-Stack Web Development Framework: The project will use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to build an interactive website that provides detailed visualizations and data integration. The platform will feature user-friendly interfaces for navigating climate data, rooftop suitability maps, and urban agriculture potential. Additionally, backend development in Python or Java will facilitate geospatial algorithm implementation and real-time data updates. 6. Integrate Open Geospatial Data for Climate Analysis: By incorporating open geospatial datasets, such as those available through Google Earth Engine, the website will provide high-resolution satellite data to support LST extraction and urban heat mapping. The platform will also incorporate OpenStreetMap (OSM) for street-level mapping and data integration, allowing users to explore UHI effects at a granular level. Importance of UHI Mitigation in Ranchi Ranchi is rapidly urbanizing, leading to increased surface temperatures and exacerbating the Urban Heat Island effect. This presents both environmental and public health challenges, including the risk of heat-related illnesses, energy demand spikes, and worsened air quality. Mitigating UHI effects in Ranchi is essential for improving the city's resilience to climate change and enhancing the quality of life for its residents. In addition to cooling the urban environment, rooftop agriculture can serve as a local solution to food insecurity, particularly for vulnerable communities. By converting underutilized rooftops into productive agricultural spaces, the project aims to improve access to fresh produce while also reducing the city's environmental footprint. Technological Innovations for UHI Mitigation The project's reliance on advanced geospatial tools, satellite data, and machine learning algorithms will provide Ranchi with state-of-the-art urban heat analysis. Cloud masking and radiometric calibration will ensure the accuracy of satellite imagery, while the Simplified Urban-Extent (SUE) algorithm will enable precise LST calculations. Through the use of Google Earth Pro and mobile-based ground verification, the project will not only identify rooftops suitable for agriculture but also verify their feasibility in the field. This hybrid approach of satellite and on-the-ground data collection will result in accurate, actionable insights for urban planners, environmental advocates, and local communities. Furthermore, the development of an interactive website powered by the MERN stack will provide a user-friendly platform for accessing UHI data. By integrating OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Google Earth Engine datasets, the website will offer comprehensive, street-level mapping of UHI intensities across Ranchi. The platform will be designed to engage users, allowing them to explore potential rooftop agriculture sites and gain insights into climate change impacts at the local level. Conclusion The Urban Heat Island mitigation project in Ranchi represents a significant step forward in addressing both local climate challenges and food insecurity. By prioritizing urban rooftops for agriculture and providing a technological platform for UHI analysis, the project combines environmental sustainability with social innovation. The integration of advanced geospatial tools, satellite imagery, and user-friendly web interfaces will make climate data more accessible to the public and empower communities to take action against rising temperatures. This project serves as a model for other cities facing similar challenges, demonstrating the potential of urban agriculture and digital platforms to mitigate UHI effects and promote a more sustainable, resilient future. Through a combination of innovative technology, practical field verification, and community engagement, the project aims to reduce Ranchi's UHI intensity while fostering sustainable urban development.
